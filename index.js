//There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
//other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
//Your tasks:
//1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
//2. Compare the team&#39;s average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
//and print it to the console. Don&#39;t forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
//as well (draw means they have the same average score)
//3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
//team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
//score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
//score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
//4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
//both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
//points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
//Test data:
//ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
//ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
//ยง Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
